### How to add some news or announcement
#### If you know how to edit a JSON file
* Create a PR for Android and/or iPhone installs of the Open Food Facts app.
* Android: https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app_assets/blob/main/prod/tagline/android/main.json
* iPhone https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app_assets/blob/main/prod/tagline/ios/main.json
* You can customize it by country, language and operating system, with start and end dates.
#### Otherwise
* [File a request](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app_assets/issues/new/choose) 
### My news/announcement isn't showing
